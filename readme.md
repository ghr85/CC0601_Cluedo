# Codeclan Week 06 Day 01
## Introduction to JavaScript
### UNderstanding Javascript Scope

In this task you are given a number of 'Episodes' and you have to determine the outcome
by paying particular attention to scope.

#### Notes
* Take it slowly, as with Ruby arrays/hashes one little bracket can throw your answer.
* Const is not global! Variables with undefined scope are global!

#### Files
* whodunnit.js - Javascript file where each episode was run from. Check history for each question.
* whodunnit_instructions.md - Overall list of questions and comments responding.
